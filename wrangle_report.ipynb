    "### Gathering Data\n",
    "- Gathering Data for this Project involved obtaining three different datasets from three different sources. Each one testing a different way of obtaining a dataset.\n",
    "- The first was to download a file manually and be able to open a csv file. In this case the file was called twitter_archive_enhanced.csv and was the file consisting of the largest amount of data.\n",
    "- The second was to be able to download a file programmatically using Python Requests library. The file contained image predictions on the breed of the dog coming from a neural network on some of the tweets already downloaded in the archive file. The file was in tsv format and tested your ability to open this type of file successfully.\n",
    "- The final dataset tested your ability to query Twitterâ€™s API and use a Python library called Tweepy to obtain further data on the tweets in the archive file using the tweet id. The Tweepy library returned the data in json format, from which it was possible to iterate through and append data to a file as a list of dictionaries and then a pandas data frame. A copy was saved in csv format of the data frame created."

    "#### Quality Issues\n",
    "- wrong data types (tweet_id need to convert it to string)\n",
    "- wrong data types (timestamp need to convert it to datetime)\n",
    "- Reducing the 3 columns that predict the Breed of the dog in the table then drop('img_num','p1','p1_conf','p1_dog','p2','p2_conf','p2_dog','p3','p3_conf','p3_dog') columns as we no loger need them.\n",
    "- remove the tweets that has no image.\n",
